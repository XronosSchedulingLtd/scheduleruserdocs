Repeating events
================

--------
Concepts
--------

Once you have entered an event into Scheduler, you can cause it
to be repeated through the academic year.  You can specify:

- Start date
- End date
- Days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc)
- Which weeks (Week A, Week B, Holidays)
- When in a month (first Monday, third Tuesday, etc.)

Any resources attached to your original event will be attached to
all the copies as well.  Your original event functions as a kind
of prototype to create all the others.

When you repeat an event like this, each instance is an event in
its own right, but the whole set are joined together under an
umbrella record.  You can still edit the events individually,
but you can also use any of them to repeat the repetition process,
bringing them all back into line.

You enter events into Scheduler in much the same way as you would
for any calendaring program, but with one big difference - they
are structured.  Each event carries information about the resources -
people, places and services - involved in it.

Restrictions
------------

Events which have been imported from your MIS or other external
sources are excluded from the repetition facility.  Typically
these are things like lessons and meetings, and if they are
due to repeat then that should already have been taken care of
before they were imported.

Likewise, if an event lasts for more than one calendar day you
can't use it as a prototype for repetition - it doesn't make sense
to say "Repeat on Tuesday of Week B" if the event itself is longer
than a day.

You can only repeat events to which have you some degree of edit
access - specifically those where you have sub-edit permission.
You thus can't set up a repetion for arbitrary events set up by
other users (unless you are a privileged user with extra edit
permissions).

How to do it
------------

Once you've created your original event (see 
:ref:`entering_events`) you will find you have an extra link available
on the left-hand side of the "Show event" dialogue.
