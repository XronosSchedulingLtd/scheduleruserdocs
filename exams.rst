Exam invigilation
=================

---------
Overview
---------

Some School Management Information Systems are better than others at
handling the entry and maintenance of exam invigilation slots.  If
your MIS has the facility to handle these then Scheduler will import
and display them, but if not then you can do it directly with Scheduler.

Scheduler will assist you with setting up the framework of slots, scheduling
when the actual exams are, and selecting the most suitable staff to use
for each individual slot, taking into account suspended lessons
and how many slots each staff member has already done.

-----
Steps
-----

The whole job can be broken down into a number of distinct steps:

* Authorize one or people to set up invigilation
* Choose which staff can do invigilation
* Record the times of the invigilation slots
* Record the days on which the exams will occur
* Record which rooms are to be used
* Generate the event records
* Allocate the right number of staff for each location and time
* Tweaking
