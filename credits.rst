Scheduler is written in Ruby, using the Rails application framework.

The underlying database is MySQL.

For calendar display it makes use of FullCalendar, with the general
interface being driven by Zurb Foundation.

The target server runs Debian GNU/Linux version 8 (Jessie) although
it should be possible to run the software on any Linux variant, MacOS X,
or even Windows.
