Quick tour
==============

When you first access Scheduler you will see a page much like this:

It is showing the school's public calendar, which is available
for anyone to view. Note the buttons at top left for moving forwards or
backwards by a week, and the buttons top right where you can change to a
Month, Week or Day view.

You can click on any event to get more information about it (like who is
organising it), or you can use the two boxes in the top bar to jump to a
specific date, or to do a textual search for a particular event.
The text search is reasonably intelligent, so if you search for,
for instance "u16 rugby", it will find any event which mentions both
"u16" and "rugby" in any order. It is not case sensitive.

If you log in, you can do much more. Click on the "Sign in" button at
the top right of the screen, and sign in using your school Gmail account.

You should then see a screen much more like this:


Note that in addition to the public calendar events, I can now see my own
personal timetable as well.

To make the display less cluttered, you can temporarily hide the calendar
events by clicking on the tick next to "Calendar" in the left-hand side
bar.

The entries in blue are my normal scheduled items, whilst those in red
are my cover lessons for the week. Invigilation slots will also appear
in red as and when they arise.

There are more things shown here than come just from the timetable.
All sorts of events can be edited into Scheduler and will then appear
automatically on the schedules of those affected.

A new entry box has also appeared, at the top of the side-bar on the left.
This is extremely powerful because it will let you look at the schedule
for any other person, place, or category of event. Say I want to know
whether the Amey Theatre might be available for a lecture. I type
"Amey Theatre" in the "Add watch item" box, select the correct entry
and press enter. Immediately I can see the schedule for the Amey Theatre
as well.

Or perhaps I want to know about sports fixtures:

Each of these items can be made to appear and disappear temporarily by
clicking on the ticks next to the corresponding name. If you decide you
want to get rid of it (semi-)permanently, click on the cross.

You can always add it again later using the text box at the top.

Similarly, you can see the schedule for any colleague or pupil by typing
his or her name into the "Add watch item" box. You will see all the
scheduled events for that individual, including timetable, cover,
extra-curricular actitivies, trips, and anything else which has been
entered.

Once you start using more complicated functions within Scheduler, you can
always return to the calendar page by clicking on the "Scheduler" message
at the top left of the screen.
