Xronos Scheduler is a scheduling program designed primarily for use in
schools, but potentially of use elsewhere.

To the casual user, it at first looks much like any other calendaring
program, but the major difference is that instead of holding lots of
separate calendars it stores a single structured schedule for
the entire organisation. It then provides the means to pick and choose
what you see.  Casual browsers see only events which are flagged as
being public, but logged in users have far more control.

Scheduler is designed to import whatever schedule information is available
from your existing MIS - e.g. Timetable, Cover, Extra-Curricular activities -
but then it merges that with its own information, to produce a complete
schedule for any member of staff, pupil or location within the school.

Users can pick and choose what they see, check for free time, or
identify free resources at a given time (e.g. an unused ICT room).
