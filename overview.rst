Xronos Scheduler is a scheduling program designed primarily for use in
schools, but potentially of use elsewhere.

Its objective is to provide all the information which staff and pupils
need about what's happening in the school and when *all in one place*.
Usually all this information already exists within the school, but it's
spread around a dozen different sources.  Even information stored within
a single MIS can't usually be viewed all in one go - you look in one
place for your basic timetable, another for the prep timetable, another
for external events, etc.  Each member of staff then has to work out,
for instance, which pupils will be missing from a lesson because all the
year 11 geography students are going on a field trip.  This kind of
work really should be done by a computer, and Scheduler does exactly
that.

To the casual user, it at first looks much like any other calendaring
program, but the major difference is that instead of holding lots of
separate calendars it stores a single structured schedule for
the entire organisation. It then provides the means to pick and choose
what you see.  Casual browsers see only events which are flagged as
being public, but logged in users have far more control.

Scheduler is designed to import whatever schedule information is available
from your existing MIS - e.g. Timetable, Cover, Extra-Curricular activities -
but then it merges that with its own information, to produce a complete
schedule for any member of staff, pupil or location within the school.

Users can pick and choose what they see, check for free time, or
identify free resources at a given time (e.g. an unused ICT room).
