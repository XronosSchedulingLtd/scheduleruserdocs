Calendar feeds
==============

All the information held within Scheduler can be viewed directly
within the program, but it can also be convenient for users to
see the information relevant them in their external calendards, or
on their mobile devices.

Scheduler provides highly configurable calendar feeds, which are
compatible with pretty much any calendaring program.  It can provide
a feed of events relevant to any resource which it knows about - whether
a real resource like a member of staff, pupil or room, or a virtual resource
like the school's public calendar, or its sports fixtures.

------
Set up
------

Calendar feeds are specified by means of a Uniform Resource Locator
or URL.  Scheduler will construct the necessary URLs for you automatically.
You then pass the URL to your calendaring program of choice (usually by
copying it to your clipboard and pasting it into that program) and
it will then fetch the desired events directly from Scheduler.

Logged in to the Scheduler demo system, click on Simon Philpotts's name
on the left hand side to see a screen like this:

   :scale: 75%
   :align: center

Notice that there are three tabs on this screen - Appearance, Feeds and Report.
Click on the Feeds tab, to get a screen like this:

   :scale: 75%
   :align: center

There are various pre-constructed URLs here.  The first two are the
simplest to use.  Of these, the first will give a feed of breakthrough
events, not specific to Simon Philpotts himself, but relevant to the
whole school.  Typically they will be term dates, week letters etc.

The second URL is for the whole of Simon Philpotts's schedule in one go -
his timetable, plus all the other events in which he is explicitly
involved.  Click on the icon to the right of it to copy it to your
clipboard, and then paste it into your calendar program of choice.  After
a short delay, all the events relevant to SJP will appear in your
calendar program.

How often they are refreshed depends on your calendaring program, but
typically Google Calendar seems to refresh them about every 24 hours.

If you'd like to get things broken down further, go for the URLs in
the next section of the page.  The first one (for breakthrough events)
is the same as before, but the other two will separate out cover
and invigilation events and provide them in separate feeds.  You can
thus choose to display them in different colours in your external
calendaring program.

The end result in Google Calendar can look like this:

If you then synchronize your portable device with your Google Calendar,
you have your timetable always to hand - and up to date!
